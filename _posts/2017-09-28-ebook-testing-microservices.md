> _Ham... I opened that Testing Microservices blog post you bugged me with. It said "37 minutes read". Then I opened the second post and it said "43 minutes read". Then I closed my browser. Are you serious?_

That was the first feedback I received from [Manuel](https://twitter.com/ManuelPuetz) and [Lukasz](https://twitter.com/lplotni), two of my lovely coworkers. I guess they had a point.

Yeah, I know. Things got a little out of hand when I wrote the last [blog post series](/blog/testing-microservices). It's a _little_ long and reading long blog posts might not be your thing. After receiving overly positive feedback from the folks who were persistent enough to read through the hughe wall of text online I figured out it makes sense to publish _Testing Microservices_ for more accessible offline reading.

With the help of the fantastic [Asciidoctor](http://asciidoctor.org/) I published the article as an E-book. 

It's all open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/hamvocke/testing-microservices-ebook) ready for you to download. Go ahead and grab the latest [PDF](https://github.com/hamvocke/testing-microservices-ebook/raw/master/testing-microservices.pdf), [EPUB](https://github.com/hamvocke/testing-microservices-ebook/raw/master/testing-microservices.epub) or [MOBI](https://github.com/hamvocke/testing-microservices-ebook/raw/master/testing-microservices.mobi) version, send it to your e-reader and read the whole thing offline as often and as slow or fast as you like.

If you spot any typos or mistakes I'd love if you'd send me a pull request.
