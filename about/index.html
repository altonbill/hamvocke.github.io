	<h1>Hi, I'm <a href="/blog/ham">Ham!</a></h1>

	<div class="image"><img src="../assets/img/ham.jpg" alt="Ham Vocke" class="img-circle float-right"></div>

	<p>I'm a Software Developer living in Northwest Germany, working remotely for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/company">Stack Overflow</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Previously, I worked at <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com">ThoughtWorks</a> as a Consultant and Software Developer. Even further down the memory lane I started my life as a software developer at <a href="https://www.bertelsmann.de">Bertelsmann</a> where I got to learn the tools of the trade.</p>

	<p>I love building software and am grateful that I could turn that into my profession.</p>

        <p>My career allowed me to dive into a lot of different domains and technologies and to work with a bunch of fun companies. From <abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr> household devices to car manufacturers, insurance companies and big e-commerce shops, SaaS products and online communities, from delivering software to consulting teams to tech leading, I've experienced quite some different constellations. And as everyone loves a good list of buzzwords here are some of the things I care about or have worked with in the past:</p>
